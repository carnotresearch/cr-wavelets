Initial release

* Refactored wavelets module from [CR-Sparse]((https://cr-sparse.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.2/))
  into an independent CR-Wavelets library.

Please note that this version is a follow up from the last CR-Sparse release v0.2.2.
Hence, the starting version number for this library is a continuation from that.
