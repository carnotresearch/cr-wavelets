            See :ref:`Modes <ref-wt-modes>` for available modes.
        axis (int, optional): The axis along which the vectors from data will be picked for computing DWT. Default -1 (last axis).
        level (int, optional): The number of decomposition levels for which DWT will be computed. If the level is 
            unspecified, then it will be computed automatically based on data length and wavelet decomposition filter length.
