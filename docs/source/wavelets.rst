``CR-Wavelets`` provides support for both DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)
and CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform).


The support for discrete wavelets is a partial port of 
wavelets functionality from the `PyWavelets <https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ project. 
The functionality has been written on top of JAX. While PyWavelets gets its performance from the C extensions in its 
implementation, we have built the functionality on top of JAX API. 

- API and implementation are both based on functional programming paradigm.
- There are no C extensions. All implementation is pure Python.
- The implementation takes advantage of XLA and can run easily on GPUs and TPUs.

Continuous Wavelet Transform have been implemented following :cite:`torrence1998practical`.
A reference implementation using NumPy is 
`here <https://github.com/aaren/wavelets>`_. 


The code examples in this section will assume following imports::

  import cr.wavelets as wt


Discrete Wavelets
--------------------------------------


API is available at two levels

- Functions which directly correspond to the high level API of PyWavelets.
- Lower level functions which are JIT compiled.

The high level functions involve handling a variety of use cases for
the arguments passed. For example, they can accept lists as well as
JAX nd-arrays. These functions cannot be JIT compiled. Lower level 
functions have been carefully designed to accept arguments which 
fit the JIT rules of JAX. They can be embedded in another JIT 
compiled function.

Current support is focused on discrete wavelet transforms. 
Following wavelets are supported.

Signal Extension Modes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Real world signals are finite. They are typically stored in 
finite size arrays in computers. Computing the wavelet transform
of signal values around the boundary of the signal inevitably involves
assuming some form of signal extrapolation. A simple extrapolation
method is to extend the signal with zeros at the boundary. 
Reconstruction of the signal from its wavelet coefficients may introduce
boundary artifacts based on how the signal was extrapolated. A careful
choice of signal extension method is necessary based on actual 
application. 

We provide following signal extension modes at the moment.

zero
  Signal is extended by adding zeros::

    >>> wt.pad(jnp.array([1,2,4,-1,2,-1]), 2, 'zero')
    DeviceArray([ 0,  0,  1,  2,  4, -1,  2, -1,  0,  0], dtype=int64)


constant
  Border values of the signal are replicated::

    >>> wt.pad(jnp.array([1,2,4,-1,2,-1]), 2, 'constant')
    DeviceArray([ 1,  1,  1,  2,  4, -1,  2, -1, -1, -1], dtype=int64)


symmetric
  Signal is extended by mirroring the samples at the border in mirror form. 
  The border sample is also mirrored.::

    >>> wt.pad(jnp.array([1,2,4,-1,2,-1]), 2, 'symmetric')
    DeviceArray([ 2,  1,  1,  2,  4, -1,  2, -1, -1,  2], dtype=int64)


reflect
  Signal is extended by reflecting the samples around the border sample.
  Border sample is not copied in the extension.:: 

    >>> wt.pad(jnp.array([1,2,4,-1,2,-1]), 2, 'reflect')
    DeviceArray([ 4,  2,  1,  2,  4, -1,  2, -1,  2, -1], dtype=int64)

periodic
  Signal is extended periodically. The samples at the end repeat at the extension
  at the beginning. The samples at the beginning repeat at the extension at the end.::

    >>> wt.pad(jnp.array([1,2,4,-1,2,-1]), 2, 'periodic')
    DeviceArray([ 2, -1,  1,  2,  4, -1,  2, -1,  1,  2], dtype=int64)

periodization
  The signal is extended the same way as the periodic extension. The major difference is that
  the number of wavelet coefficients is identical to the length of the signal. All extra values
  are trimmed.

Many of the signal extension modes are similar to the padding modes supported by the
``jax.numpy.pad`` function. However, the naming convention is different and follows 
PyWavelets.

Codec
--------------------

The library provides a set of utility functions
which can be used to build wavelet based codecs.
Sample codec has also been provided. A codec
provides two functions: encoder and decoder.
An encoder takes a signal block and generates
a ``bitarray``. A decoder takes a ``bitarray``
and reconstructs the signal block.
